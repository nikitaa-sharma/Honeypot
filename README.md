# Honeypot
Terminal Honeypot

This Python-based honeypot, simulates a secure terminal login system to:

✅ Capture unauthorized login attempts

✅ Log credentials (username & password) with timestamps

✅ Simulate an authorized session for deception

✅ Lock out after multiple failed attempts

Perfect for security research, penetration testing, and monitoring unauthorized access attempts in a controlled environment.

# Note: you don't have to create honeypot_logs.txt manually, it will automatically get created once you run the honeypot.py file ;)
